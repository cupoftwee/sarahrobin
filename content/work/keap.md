Working as a frontend developer, I helped build out the user interface of their smart calendar product using Vue. It is always a joy to work with a large team on a project built with TDD principles in mind, and this product in particular was fantastic. My first real Typescript job, and while it was challenging at first, I've grown to love the language.
