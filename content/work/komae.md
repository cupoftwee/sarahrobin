I helped build & expand Komae's first product, a platform allowing for community-based childcare exchange called Wana. Working on Wana, I switched between backend, web, and mobile client developer roles, working with Node, Express, C#, MySQL, all deployed and automated on Azure. Client-side, I worked with Vue, Sass & Webpack for the web client and NativeScript-Vue and eventually React Native for the Komae mobile app.
