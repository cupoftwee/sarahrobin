My professional services website and blog.


### How to install and run the site
1. Install [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/docs#how-to-install) locally using `$ yarn global add @gridsome/cli`.
2. Clone the repository from `$ git clone https://github.com/cupoftwee/sarahrobin.git`.
3. Run `$ yarn install` to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) install all other local dependencies.
4. `$ yarn develop` - Run local Gridsome dev server. Same as running `$ gridsome develop`; reloading webpack dev server should spin up and run on `localhost:8080`.
5. `$ yarn build` - Compile for production to `/dist` folder.

### Prior Art & Acknolwedgments
Working in (F)OSS means that you spend every day standing on the shoulders of giants. Today, I'm standing on quite a tall stack, but I'd like to mention that Cosmin Popovici's [Bleda Gridsome Starter](https://github.com/cossssmin/gridsome-starter-bleda) helped me get up and running quickly and easily, letting me focus on learning the full range of Gridsome's capabilities. 

Cosmin's choice of theme inspiration as well, the [Attila](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila) Ghost theme, is a beautiful and solid foundation to build off of, and I am very grateful for their work ðŸ’–

Additionally, I have to make special note that this project could not have happened without the support of my wonderful and loving fiance along my friends who helped me push past an artistic block that had been clogging my heart for years. I'll spare this `README` the real sappy stuff, but if you're interested, I wrote about this process of this project further [in this blog post](https://sarahrobin.dev/writing/hello-world-portfolio-pt-1/).
