While working at Yaymaker, I helped build & launch React/Redux/GraphQL & Node/Express/Postgres internationalized ticket checkout system. Additionally, I authored curriculum and held workshops to familiarize team with new front-end libraries and practices, such as React, Redux, ES6, Babel, & Webpack.
