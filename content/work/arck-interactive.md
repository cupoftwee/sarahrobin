I worked as a full-stack generalist, going where ever the project needed - backend (Node, Mongo, Postgres, 12 factor apps), frontend (Vue/React/Typescript), design (Figma/UX/UI), QA (testing, both manual and automated w/ > 50% code coverage), or technical product management (archtecture, spec generation, client liasing). Variety is the spice of life, and agency work is never boring!
