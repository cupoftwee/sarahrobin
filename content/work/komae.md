The logo in the top left is a stylized icon of a child reaching up in the shape of a 'K' and the name of the website is 'Komae'. The main site features a sales pitch for the childcare exchange platform, on the left and a picture of a smiling woman with long sandy-blonde hair and a warm smile that is cut off below her chin."

I helped build & expand Komae's first product, a platform allowing for community-based childcare exchange called Wana. Working on Wana, I switched between backend, web, and mobile client developer roles, working with Node, Express, C#, MySQL, all deployed and automated on Azure. Client-side, I worked with Vue, Sass & Webpack for the web client and NativeScript-Vue and eventually React Native for the Komae mobile app.
