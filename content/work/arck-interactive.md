I worked as a full-stack generalist, going where ever the project needed - backend (Node, Mongo, Postgres, 12 factor apps), frontend (vue/react/typescript), design (figma/ux/wireframes), QA (testing, both manual and automated > 50% coverage), or product management (archtecture, spec generation, client liasing). Variety is the spice of life, and agency work is never boring!
