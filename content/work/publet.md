While working for the sadly now-defunct Publet, I designed, architected, and built a React/Redux product for WYSIWYG authoring of block-based multimedia content on top of Django API (tl;dr -  Wordpress Gutenberg, but in 2015). I also helped create a Node.js service to convert & render PDFs into web pages that could then be edited in the WYSIWYG React client.
