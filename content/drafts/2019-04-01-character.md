The other day, somewhere between pull request and existential crisis, I found myself thinking about how we, as humans, percieve and interact with computers. Y'know, totally normal internal dialogue ;p Anyways, from an early age, I had been fascinated with computers. I loved video games, and at that point being even vaguely internet-savvy felt like a superpower. 

My elders always had words of caution when I got excited by some new feature or technical advance. "Garbage in, garbage out," I heard with somber nods over every holiday meal. _Computers will not save you._ Not too bad, as far as generic ominous tech advice goes. 

But, to my impressionable brain, there was a different lesson to be learned: Nomatter how frustrated I got with a computer, it was doing its best, and I had to support it. I had to remind myself with every extension error or BSOD that they didn't know any better, and I had to understand it better to find what ailed it.

I think my conception of the id as an operating system isn't off-base, just a different perspective than the standard imagery most folks have. Computers are basically infants: They're incredibly dependent and very fragile, throwing tantrums if basic needs aren't met. They have very little conception of your world and context, regardless of how you simplify it for them (IE, code). Generalizing here, but I spent my childhood humanizing them and forming emotional attachments to them while most of my in-person experiences with other humans hurt.
