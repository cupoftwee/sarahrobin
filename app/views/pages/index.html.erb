    <h2>Stuff &amp; Things</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm a designer and engineer who enjoys building platforms and technologies that make peopleâ€™s lives better. Also, pretty web things!
    </p>

    <p>
      For development, I commonly work w/ a varied Javascript stack for rapid prototyping and full-stack MVP projects (though a mature, well-maintained JS or TypeScript codebase can be a beautiful thing). I also tinker in Python, love writing Ruby, and I'm learning Rust.
    </p>

    <p>
      For design, I prefer an empathetic and people-centered approach to product development and user experience, that works towards responsible growth. I want to make a positive impact in people's lives, and that usually involves more listening to feedback than dictating solutions. Design just isn't how it works, its who it works for, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      For pretty web things, I use whatever I can get my hands on (canvas, SVG, OpenGL, etc). My current process is to create some kind of simulated life that scurries around, spilling pixels all over a canvas in a beautiful way (my profile's cover image was made this way). My eventual goal is to create simulated life that can judge the spilled pixels better than I can
